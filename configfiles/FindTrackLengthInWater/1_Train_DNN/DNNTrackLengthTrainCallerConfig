############### Training #################
# Note: If we're going to train immediately following the FindTrackLengthInWater tool,
# we need to switch Execute and Finalise functions. This makes the tool do nothing while
# the input csv file is filled during the Execute loops, then train the DNN model
# in the finalise step
